# ComputerCarKey

# This repository is a recreation of a repository I previously worked on with Scott Young, Dawson Markham, and Benjammin Hargrove
# This repository is better organized than the original, and has several redundant or unneeded files removed. Only files needed for the project remain.

# The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/scotty2hottie98/CYEN_Senior_Design

# Computer Car Keys is a project intended to help users protect their files by using 2FA and encryption.
# When using Computer Car Keys, users will be prompted for serveral things including which file they wish to encrypt/decrypt and the password associated with that file

# If the password is correct and users have the corresponding USB device used when creating the password, the file will encrypt/decrypt
