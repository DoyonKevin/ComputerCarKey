# Computer Car Keys is a project intended to help users protect their files by using 2FA and encryption.
# When using Computer Car Keys, users will be prompted for serveral things including which file they wish to encrypt/decrypt and the password associated with that file

# If the password is correct and users have the corresponding USB device used when creating the password, the file will encrypt/decrypt
